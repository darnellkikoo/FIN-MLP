# COMP67450001-FinalProject

#### Airplanes have always been the most favored choice in traveling abroad due to their safety and speed. However, the <a href='https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted' target='_blank' style='text-decoration:none;'>COVID-19 pandemic</a> that's been going on for the last two years has caused a break in ticket sales for almost all airlines, making the airline business sector suffer heavy losses. 
#### With the pandemic starting to fade, the number of passengers has <a href='https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2022-releases/2022-03-01-01/' target='_blank' style='text-decoration:none;'>recovered substantially</a>, and living standards have also improved. As the living standards went up, airline companies should also improve their services. This translates to a need for a decision-supporting system capable of analyzing passenger satisfaction. 
#### This project uses data from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction' target='_blank' style='text-decoration:none;'>airline passenger satisfaction survey</a> to predict whether a passenger is satisfied with their flight. We divided the model design process into 2 phases: <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ozDpPvwTh44hDEafooDxac9SjwNuupHl?usp=sharing' target='_blank' style='text-decoration:none;'> Data Analysis </a> and <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z2fyWWOsGw1KpCCJN4htMguOG4dEYOzV?usp=sharing' target='_blank' style='text-decoration:none;'>Modelling</a>.

## Steps of Deployment

1. Create a virtual environment by typing ```python -m venv env``` in the command prompt 

2. Use the Python interpreter from the virtual environment using ctrl+shift+p and selecting Python Interpreter

3. Wait until the workspace's python interpreter changes into that of the venv

4. Move to the Python (env) terminal install all requirements by typing ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

5. Run the web application by typing ```streamlit run main.py```
